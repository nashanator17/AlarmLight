Sunlight alarm (Beginner Arduino Project)

First project playing around with the arduino. I read online that it is much easier to wake up in the morning with the aid of light. Unfortunately, commercial sunlight alarms are on the market for close to $60 so I found an alternative. I programmed the servo motor to flick my light switch at a set time. No more tired mornings!
